# Chicken_Diseases_Classification
🐔 Chicken Diseases Classification Project
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based image classification system to detect various chicken diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to support poultry health monitoring through AI-powered disease identification, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and prevention.
